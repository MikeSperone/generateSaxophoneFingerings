# generateSaxophoneFingerings
This is to generate a starting point of a list of saxophone fingerings.

The generated fingerings are based on a standard contemporary alto saxophone with 23 keys.
The data generated represents fingerings where a 1 is a key pressed with a finger, and a 0 is unpressed (however due to saxophone mechanics, this could possibly be a depressed key).

Rules used to exclude certain fingerings include:

1. no more than 10 keys depressed at a time (assuming 10 fingers)

... additional rules for keys which become activated or non-functional due to another key pressed...
(documentation to be added soon... )
